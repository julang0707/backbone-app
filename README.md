# Backbone JS App


## Due Date:

### Thursday, July 30, 2015 at 8am

## Assignment:
- Create an app using BackboneJS
- Must have one model, view, and collection

## Goals:
- Demonstrate a thorough understanding of BackboneJS

## My App- Math Mania
- Objective: app for kids to practice generating expressions that evaluate to the random number given (example: given 19 and user inputs 21-2)
- Shuffle button in header that displays a random number from 1-20 upon click
- Enter an expression and upon enter it is evaluated against the number displayed
  - if true alert of "Good Job!" appears in the footer
  - if false alert of "Try Again!" appears in the footer
- User clicks Shuffle button again to be given a new number and start the process again

### Views
- AppView
- ShuffleView
- InputView
- ResultsView

### Models
- NumModel
- ResultsModel

### Collections
- Inputs


## Results
Not much success in accomplishing my goal of building the defined app in one evening.  I would like to revisit this when I have a deeper understanding of BackboneJS.
